      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we finally left the North Rim area of the Grand Canyon, we drove off of the Kaibab Plateau and over to Utah. We stopped for the night in Hatch in a nice little campground. Good prices and the most amazing bathrooms of the trip so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=255178074499020&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=255178074499020&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sunset we drove on into Bryce Canyon. On the way there we passed through Red Canyon, which has several smaller features and is a nice introduction to the area. We stopped for a few pictures, then drove on in. Once there, we drove up to a lookout point or two and hiked out to the viewing areas. The main roads are all on the western side of the canyon area, and you really can&amp;rsquo;t see much of anything until you hike out to an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248887708461390&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248887708461390&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really was a stunning view. Some areas were perfectly lit by the setting sun, others looked like they would be optimally lit at sunrise. But the hoodoos were rather mesmerizing. We began to look forward to actually getting down among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252091171474377&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252091171474377&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove out early and got a good head start on the day. Inspiration point was glorious in the early morning sun. Then we prepared for our big hike. And let me at this point say a little something about warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signs at many National Parks attempt to warn people about the dangers of hiking. A sign at the Grand Canyon even has a photo of a woman who ran marathons who died out there on the trails. I take all such advice into consideration and try very hard not to be one of those statistics. And yet when we hit the trails we are surrounded by people who seem to have completely ignored all signs. They have very little water, if any. They are in tennis shoes. They are often very overweight. And yet all of these people (as far as I know) seem to manage to make it back to the parking lot just fine. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the signs are overstating the dangers? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Just a few days ago two hikers surprised a mother Grizzly and her two cubs at Yellowstone. The Grizzly mauled and killed the male hiker on the spot. So one certainly needs to be careful out there. But we often feel a bit overdressed with our hiking shoes and Camelbak water backpacks and our daypack. But hey, at least we&amp;rsquo;ll have food to throw at any bears we encounter. &lt;img src=&#34;http://v2j.vagabondians.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:)&#34; class=&#34;wp-smiley&#34; style=&#34;height: 1em; max-height: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way, we left sunrise point and descended. It was a bit like stepping off of a spacecraft onto another planet. At every turn you got a whole new angle on everything in sight. The result of this was a bazillion photos. We eventually made our way to the bottom of the trail and took a snack break in the shade. Soon after we came to the final part of the trail, exiting the canyon. It was a series of steep switchbacks. Evidently they recommend this particular direction because this end of the trail has shade. Probably a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252092894807538&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252092894807538&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252116551471839&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252116551471839&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After surviving that trail, we drove down to the end of the park and hiked the Bristlecone Pine trail. Lots of crazy old trees out there. On the way back in, we stopped at several lookouts, eventually making our way back to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252141731469321&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252141731469321&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252142801469214&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252142801469214&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryce Canyon was great, possibly Glenn&amp;rsquo;s favorite location so far!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hoodoo You Think You Are?</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/hoodoo-are/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Georgia} &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;Pictures of Bryce Canyon evoke wonder, but taking in the view from Inspiration Point for the first time in person takes your breath away.  An open-mouthed &amp;ldquo;Whohhhhhhhhhh&amp;rdquo; is about all I could muster from my overwhelmed senses.  The heady aroma of warm Ponderosa pine in the late afternoon mountain sun tipped my brain right over the precipice down into the hoodoos. The trail through the canyon beckoned that I should just run right down there and lose myself in their mysterious fairytale world, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately sanity eventually returned, if I ever had it to begin with, and I settled for a promised trip down in the morning.  The ranger suggested that it&amp;rsquo;s best to begin at Sunrise Point and end at Sunset Point for the &amp;ldquo;best three-mile hike on earth.&amp;rdquo; We were filled with glee as the view changed dramatically every few steps.  The cameras were going to get a workout today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249784715038356&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249784715038356&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long, yet still fairly steep, switchbacks seemed to confirm the choice of direction, as we marveled at how hard the people had to work to get up out of the canyon as we descended.  As we got deeper, the hoodoos seemed to grow taller as they dwarfed us in their mystic shadows.  The colors seemed to intensify as they worked their witchery on us.  On we went, around and through this natural wonderland, hoping we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fall into any rabbit holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249786228371538&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249786228371538&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wound through and ended up in a nice pine forest for a while.  We took an apple break in the lap of a friendly tree.  Then as we sat in its shade we spied a lone figure lying in a tree across the way.  We watched as people passed him up, laughing at his misfortune.  He seemed so sad sitting there.  No telling how long he&amp;rsquo;d been there.  We took our time on our break, and no one came to rescue him, so we decided to save him and he rode behind me, waving to people out of my backpack, just in case we would pass his original negligent owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249791031704391&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249791031704391&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249792411704253&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249792411704253&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249794008370760&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249794008370760&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon we came to the way up out of the canyon.  It looked like nice long switchbacks, and we were glad.  Little did we know that we were in for straight-up, zipper switchbacks carved into the side of the mountain after  passing through a near slot canyon space that was filtering very welcome cool air through the rocks.  But the entire experience was well worth the panting effort to get back out, safe and sound and free of hexes&amp;hellip;.maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249803251703169&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249803251703169&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way back to the car and no one exclaimed as we passed by, and that&amp;rsquo;s how Roxi got her new friend&amp;hellip;.Soxi.  Perhaps Soxi has some mysterious ways about him, but he seems happy to ride balanced in the crook of the assist handle by the windshield with Roxi in the higher crows nest handle, ready to assist with directions or provide refreshment at the campsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249806868369474&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249806868369474&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to Zion National Park, and even with its hulking mountains and merry running river in the desert, it hardly holds a candle to Bryce.  It&amp;rsquo;s a shame we didn&amp;rsquo;t see it first so that we could appreciate the majesty there without the spell of the hoodoos&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
