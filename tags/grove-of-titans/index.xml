      <description>&lt;p&gt;After our own big &amp;lsquo;day of discovery&amp;rsquo; with the Grove of Titans, the next day we moved on to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, home of some of the tallest Coast Redwoods. My hopes were not very high as the location of this grove is even more secret than the Grove of Titans. In addition, it is relatively easy to spot the huge misshapen behemoths that are the Titans when they are so much larger at ground level. In comparison, one of the tallest trees in the Atlas Grove is barely nine feet in circumference! Without our own expensive laser range finder or LIDAR unit it would be next to impossible to find this grove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did hope for a glimpse of the Arco Giant which was supposedly visible from the meadow in front of the visitor center. I looked, but I did not find. In the meantime we checked out some park maps and decided to hike some of the trails. We started with a nice little half-mile loop that was supposed to be a simple nature trail. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277886715561489&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277886715561489&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing a small bridge, the trail was supposed to curve to the left then cross back over the creek again and lead back to the  visitor center. So we crossed the bridge and came to a sign which seemed to indicate that the nature trail went both left and right. I just assumed that perhaps the trail went a bit further than the map indicated so we turned left and marched on. The further we went, the more I began to notice some things. First, this trail did not seem to be as wide or well-worn as the other parts. Second, some downed limbs and even small trees had not been cleared from the trail. Third, we met no other hikers along the way. However, we did continue to see informational markers with various messages on them, so we continued on. Eventually we spied an RV on the other side of the creek. I knew that there was a campground over there, but I thought it was past the bridge we were looking for. Nevertheless, onward we pressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889252227902&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889252227902&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we concluded that we had hiked for a good mile and a half, perhaps two miles. I consulted the map again and discovered that the bridge we were looking for crossed the creek well &lt;em&gt;ahead&lt;/em&gt; of the camping area. We had flat out missed it somewhere. But rather than turn around, we decided to continue toward a bike trail that should have been just ahead. But it was not to be. The trail became fainter and more overgrown until it eventually just died out. It was an eerie feeling. We were deep in the woods, all alone. The large ferns spread up the hillsides among the giant hemlocks, the redwoods now conspicuously absent. We were wearing light jackets since the air was a bit cool and misty and the plants were shoulder high and sporting the occasional spider web, but inside we were drenched in sweat. We turned around for the march home. We tried one last shortcut at a spot where the creek was shallow and had just enough rocks and gravel to hop over, but there was no obvious trail there either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888068894687&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888068894687&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888598894634&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277888598894634&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we retraced our route. I was more than a bit upset at the park for leaving this trail off the maps, yet not blocking it off at the entrance or somehow warning us off. But eventually we got back to the trailhead where we had first turned off, and that was when I looked at the sign from a different angle, and it all made sense. What had appeared to be a sign pointing right and left was actually a sign pointing down the trail and back up the trail in the direction we had originally come from. The trail we had taken actually had a signpost right in the middle of it, but the sign itself was missing. I&amp;rsquo;m betting it said something like &amp;ldquo;Trail Closed.&amp;rdquo; To further confuse matters, we had entered the nature trail from a completely different direction than I had intended. I thought it proceeded counter-clockwise from my position when in fact we were taking the clockwise route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: As it turns out, the trail we took is an abandoned section of what used to be a longer Nature Trail loop]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889802227847&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277889802227847&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we went ahead and finished the nature trail. It was actually only one-half mile in length and took us back directly to the visitor center. After we got to the car, I changed shoes and I think shirts, then we had lunch on a bench and laughed at our stupid adventure. I decided I was done with trees for now, and we drove back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277890608894433&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=277890608894433&amp;amp;#038;set=a.277885202228307.90476.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grove of Titans</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of our favorite authors are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prestonchild.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child&lt;/a&gt;. You may have seen the movie &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zuguide.com/#The-Relic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Relic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; which was based on some of their books. Douglas Preston has also written several non-fiction books which we love. Back in May of 2007 I stumbled across a book written by Douglas&amp;rsquo; brother, Richard, entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812975596/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=selfservehost-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0812975596&#34;&gt;The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; ahvsxllnypvwxbzmklmr&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0812975596&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;. We were captivated and enthralled by these stories of people exploring vast acres of previously unexplored redwood forests and finding and climbing taller and taller trees. We began reading everything we could find about these trees, in print or on the internet. Scientists have found entire ecosystems living in the upper branches over 300 feet from the forest floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this was something we were fascinated by, we had no hope of actually seeing them until we began planning our RV road trip. As I began to look for more details it became apparent that the tallest trees for which a location was public were not actually the tallest trees any more. These scientists and enthusiasts were discovering new ones all the time! As a matter of fact, most of the 25 tallest trees were in undisclosed locations. My enthusiasm began to wane. Sure, we could still see massive Sequoias and tall Coast Redwoods, but the tallest trees would be off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late July while we were in California I began researching again and looking through my notes so we could pick a park to stay in that was convenient to the biggest trees. Most of the tallest trees were in undisclosed locations in Redwood National Park and Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It became evident that I would be unable to see them. The tallest ones we could access had once been the tallest of all, back in the late 1950&amp;rsquo;s.  Now they weren&amp;rsquo;t even in the top 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was, however, one other way of measuring trees, and that is their volume. A couple of groves have been found where the trees may not be the tallest, but they are massive. One such area is the Atlas Grove in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. The tree named Illuvatar is there, the 3rd largest Coast Redwood (in volume). It has more reiteration (new trunks growing from the main trunk) than any other known tree. It basically looks like its own little forest. Three other trees in this park are in the top 10 of the largest Coast Redwoods. But like most big trees, the locations are being kept secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grove with the largest Coast Redwoods is the Grove of Titans in the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. The only &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; grove of these redwoods in the park is the Stout Grove, with the Stout Tree being touted as the largest. In fact, it is now only 28th largest! Four of the top 10 largest Cost Redwoods are in the Grove of Titans. And while its location is still officially undisclosed, others have found it and are dropping hints all over the internet. Some wish it to be fully open to the public, others want the park to put boardwalks around it and make it an official trail, like the Stout Grove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Stout Grove&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145310200/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Stout Grove&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9145310200_60224cc046_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stout Grove&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent the possible disclosure, some are putting misleading information out there, including pins on Google Maps. While I was trying to decipher all of the clues I made a discovery. I found an actual map of the location of the Grove of Titans! We were scheduled to be there within 48 hours! I was so excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 3rd we drove into the park. Actually, we came in on the opposite side from where I had intended, but as it turns out this was the closest way in to the grove. We parked and headed out the appropriate trail, with me occasionally checking the map images I had downloaded to my iPhone. After a few false starts, we came to a spot and saw what &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been some large trees. It was difficult to tell, but the location matched the map. We waded through the underbrush no more than 300 feet or so, and there it was, a huge Coast Redwood. It was a mass of trees fused together near the base. It was the Fused Titan! We had found it, the Grove of Titans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143087303/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/9143087303_45a6a6b5c0_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145313678/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/9145313678_9f7e01eab5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We marveled at its size. We took pictures. And then we consulted the map again, turned and headed toward the others. The next tree was the largest Coast Redwood known to man, the Lost Monarch. Somehow it was even larger than the previous one. Taking pictures is one thing, seeing it in person is quite another. And then the next tree, around a fallen giant, was El Viejo del Norte, with its signature &amp;lsquo;claw&amp;rsquo; extending towards the earth. Soon we climbed over another downed tree, or perhaps branch and found our way towards a large twin tree, fused near the base. But wait, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one we were looking for. That was the NEXT tree, the Screaming Titans! This pair of trees have fused from the ground up to a height of 20-25 feet. Their combined mass is possibly larger than many others, but because they are not technically one tree they don&amp;rsquo;t get categorized with all the rest. But at breast height they have a wider circumference than the massive Sequoia General Sherman!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&#34;color: #0f3647;&#34; title=&#34;Lost Monarch&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145312822/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Lost Monarch&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5479/9145312822_bb70dcc578_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lost Monarch&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Lost Monarch&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143085513/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Lost Monarch&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2825/9143085513_7ab319e123_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lost Monarch&#34; width=&#34;450&#34; height=&#34;800&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;El Viejo del Norte&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143088773/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;El Viejo del Norte&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/9143088773_90caa5a5ef_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;El Viejo del Norte&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;El Viejo del Norte&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145314794/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;El Viejo del Norte&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/9145314794_29e49bed2e_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;El Viejo del Norte&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Screaming Titans&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143084179/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Screaming Titans&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/9143084179_449367ae07_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screaming Titans&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a title=&#34;Screaming Titans&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143084179/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Screaming Titans&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/9143084179_449367ae07_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screaming Titans&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  We spent at least an hour wandering the grove, taking it all in. Surprisingly we were not the only people there that day! Fortunately, the other explorer is someone who had previously discovered the grove and was giving his brother a tour. He gave us some clarifications on how to get to the other large tree, Del Norte which was across the river. Although we eventually found it we weren&#39;t prepared for water crossings and decided that we had seen enough for one day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Sword Ferns&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145309554/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Sword Ferns&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/9145309554_7f7cecf4b8_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sword Ferns&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although our trip is not yet over, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that anything will be able to surpass the feeling of standing in the middle of some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest living creatures. I think it will be the highlight of our journey through America. Then again, in two days we will be in Yellowstone!&lt;/p&gt;
