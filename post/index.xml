      <title>Hitting Pause on Travel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we last spoke with Glenn and Dixie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, as much as I would love to write this in the third person, I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. But yes, it&amp;rsquo;s been awhile. However, things have been pretty busy behind the scenes and in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our last update we mentioned that Glenn was going back to the States to finish out his retirement pension vesting. This is now well underway as we are now working and living in Austin, Texas. Glenn is now the sole help desk person for a governmental entity, supporting around 120 or so employees. He has already attended at least one &amp;lsquo;service awards&amp;rsquo; meeting where his fellow co-workers were receiving recognition for 25-30 years of service! That is one thing that we know we&amp;rsquo;ll never receive, and we&amp;rsquo;re fine with that. At some point in the next 3-5 years we will have fully vested pensions and replenished savings and will likely, finally retire &amp;ndash; for real. It will still be &amp;lsquo;early&amp;rsquo;, compared to most people, just not as early as we had originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In analyzing where we have ended up compared to where we intended to be by now, what we basically did was a combination of mini-retirement and self-employment. In retrospect, we would have been just fine if we had waited two years and taken off in 2013 for our nation-wide camping trip and then left for Mexico in 2014. We&amp;rsquo;d still be south of the border and have plenty of money left in the bank. But hindsight is always &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. While we regret having to go back to &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; after having lived rather foot-loose and fancy-free for the last four years, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exchange any of the wonderful memories and friends we&amp;rsquo;ve already made. Looking back, we know we jumped the gun a bit, but we regret nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve already reunited with some of our friends from Mexico who are temporarily living in Austin, and we keep up with everyone else online. We are enjoying the city while we are here, and Glenn&amp;rsquo;s job is pretty good so far. We meet up with other Spanish speakers regularly to practice. Family is close as well, and we&amp;rsquo;re seeing them as much as possible while we can. We also celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of family, it&amp;rsquo;s about time for the second day of Thanksgiving get-together meals. Dixie has a huge turkey and all the &amp;lsquo;fixings&amp;rsquo; in the kitchen and we&amp;rsquo;ll eat within the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re still working on image and video updates, as well as reworking many trip reports to more of a true travel essay format. The end result should be a much more enjoyable and readable site. We&amp;rsquo;ll let you know when there is something more to see. Thank you very much for reading, and we look forward to giving you many more things to see, hear and read in the years to come. In the meantime, we hope you all have a wonderful holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An update</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/an-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/an-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be brief, but I feel like I have to post &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; due to the long delay between articles.
First, our apologies for not having more to say. To be honest, last year we shifted from active traveling to more of an expat lifestyle. Still, there were plenty of past travel events to write about and catch up on, and we are working on those but they aren’t up yet. Coming soon, promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have discovered that Dixie simply doesn’t enjoy writing. The entire process is a lot more work than enjoyment for her, which means that keeping up blog posts is Glenn’s job. And Glenn used to do this on a fairly regular basis, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Glenn has been extremely busy. He has worked 40-50 hours a week on web development for the last 18 months. The money was ok, and it helped pay the bills, but it left little time or energy for our own site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and finally, big changes are afoot! Glenn and Dixie have decided to go back to the States and finish out Glenn’s pension vesting. He’ll still be working 40 hours a week, but when he retires he will get a decent amount of money every month, long after he stops working. Going back to a ‘real’ job isn’t what we had intended, but thirty years from now it’s very likely that we will appreciate the extra income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the news here. Glenn is working on a revamp of the site using a new photo storage service, and we fully intend to catch up on all the trips we’ve taken, going back to the early 90’s! Stay tuned, and thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Legend of Johnny Vagabond</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/legend-johnny-vagabond/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/legend-johnny-vagabond/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We first met &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnnyvagabond.com&#34; title=&#34;Johnny Vagabond&#34;&gt;Wes Nations&lt;/a&gt; our second night in San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, after &lt;a href=&#34;http://LIFEPART2.com&#34;&gt;Jon Look&lt;/a&gt; introduced us. We met at a wine bar, of course. Wes had a couple of years head-start on both Jon and ourselves, and had spent his first few years in Southeast Asia. This means he had more stories to tell, and he lived to tell stories. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure his stories were a big part of why Jon is now in Southeast Asia himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon and Wes had just returned from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnnyvagabond.com/crazy-stories/lightning-sea-turtles/&#34;&gt;crazy trip&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifepart2.com/sea-turtles-lightning-storms-and-life/&#34;&gt;Pacific coast of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chiapas. Between that trip and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifepart2.com/street-food-rat-soup/&#34;&gt;previous one&lt;/a&gt;, in which they had perused the market of a small, nearby town&lt;a href=&#34;http://johnnyvagabond.com/travel-tips/in-search-of-rat-soup/&#34;&gt; looking for rat soup&lt;/a&gt;, they had wonderful stories to tell. And by wonderful I don&amp;rsquo;t mean stories of hanging out at the pool of a pricey resort. I mean &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; stories. Stories that involve strange food, foreign languages, storms, getting lost, and maybe the occasional hallucination. Fear. Adventure. They had everything we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_4039&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/That-Wes-is-SO-Gonzo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/That-Wes-is-SO-Gonzo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;That Wes is SO Gonzo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    That Wes is SO Gonzo
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those first several months in Chiapas I often ran into Wes on one of the main walking streets of San Cristobal, mostly coffee shops or restaurants, usually a sidewalk table. I can still picture him sitting in the sun, sipping a glass of white wine, tapping away on his iPad keyboard. I referred to his usual spot at the Rincon del Toro as the Wes Nations Chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember the night we were sitting in the wine bar and after wine and some tequila shots, Wes was unusually quiet. He said that &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnnyvagabond.com/crazy-stories/tribute-to-a-friend-long-gone/&#34;&gt;a friend of his from back home in Texas had passed away&lt;/a&gt;, and it was tearing him up. I tried, weakly, to comfort him as best I could as he sat and quietly sobbed at the table. It was one of those moments when you get to strip away the bravado and the public appearance we all try to keep up. The shields were down, and his humanity shone through. Its times like this that forge bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wes was fairly well-known in travel blogger circles. One time Dixie and I were having lunch in our favorite restaurant, TierrADentro, and were approached by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://discoveringice.com/&#34;&gt;cute young couple.&lt;/a&gt; They said hi, and then asked me, &amp;ldquo;Are you Johnny Vagabond?&amp;rdquo; I got a big laugh out of this. Johnny Vagabond was Wes&amp;rsquo; alter ego and the name of &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnnyvagabond.com&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I told them that, no, I&amp;rsquo;m much younger and more handsome than him, but that I could connect them. So we exchanged information and made plans to meet up later that afternoon &amp;#8212; at the wine bar, of course. When I relayed this story to Wes, I expressed much faux indignation that anyone would mistake me for him. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time it had happened! Andre and Stephanie did get to meet him that day, and they were two of hundreds of people around the world who were inspired by his writing. But I got a story and a running inside joke out of it, and that made it special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite stories that Wes shared was about a time when he was in Vietnam, I believe. He was working at an outdoor table and a young girl came up to him selling some things. He actually needed something, although I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what now, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t have it. Later, a young boy came by, and he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have what Wes needed, so he bought one from him. A little while later, the first girl came back by and saw that Wes had bought something from someone else and not her, and became incensed! No explanation would suffice to assuage her anger and disappointment. So she sat down on the curb near his table, and for an hour or so she would look back over her shoulder every few minutes, glare at him, and say &amp;ldquo;Fuck you!&amp;rdquo; in fairly good English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chuckle every time I think about that scene. Except now the laughter quickly turns to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_4042&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/WesAndGlennAndOthers.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/WesAndGlennAndOthers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;WesAndGlennAndOthers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Wes and Jon moved on from Mexico and have traveled Central America and Southeast Asia while Dixie and I have remained somewhere between Guadalajara and Costa Rica. Our days of traveling far and wide are still in the future, scheduled to pick up in late 2017. We just missed hooking up with Wes in the summer of 2013 in Costa Rica, but finally reunited in San Cristobal in the fall of last year. We had a couple of different &amp;lsquo;tamale night&amp;rsquo; dinners with him and other friends. And we hung out at the wine bar. And we swapped tales. And Wes had a visitor &amp;ndash; Jill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Jill. Wes seemed to be anticipating a nice visit from a friend, but evidently some old flame flickered and they spent most of a week more as lovers than friends. I can&amp;rsquo;t begin to tell you how happy this made me &amp;#8212; not because I think Wes was lonely, but because he seemed genuinely happy with her, and what else can you want for a friend other than happiness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last year Jill flew to Thailand and caught up with Wes, and on January 4 of this year he announced that they were engaged! Well wishes and hundreds of likes and comments flooded his Facebook page. It seemed to be a happy portend, but the on-again, off-again nature of their relationship seemed to preclude a happy ending. Star-crossed lovers, as it were, never quite able to work out the details. He was traveling, she was stuck at a job in San Francisco. The last I heard from him, it was more off than on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this last year Wes caught a nasty virus and also had a bad reaction to some antibiotics which made him hallucinate. And at some point, he came down with a problem which eluded diagnosis for too long. In the end, an antibiotic-resistant infection lodged in his pancreas. He was offline for most of this time, in and out of hospitals, his blog uncharacteristically quiet except for an occasional post or Facebook comment. Hints of an extended hospital stay hit his Facebook page a few months ago, and many inquired for details but the information was scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, he was gone. A mutual friend broke the bad news, and Wes&amp;rsquo; Facebook page is now being flooded with remembrances and condolences. And stories. Lots of stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I am both sad and angry at this news. I&amp;rsquo;m angry that good people sometimes leave our lives early. And I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly sad that this short list now includes Wes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know him that long, and I can&amp;rsquo;t say that we were &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; friends. But he made me laugh and that&amp;rsquo;s something I truly value in a person. And when I think about it, he&amp;rsquo;s probably the closest I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a true friend in these last several years. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a homebody, a nerd, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have that many people whom I consider &amp;lsquo;close&amp;rsquo; outside of family. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why, because I&amp;rsquo;m really not sure what makes me that way. But Wes definitely got in there, into that inner circle, and his passing has saddened me greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_4040&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/WesAndDrunkGlenn.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/WesAndDrunkGlenn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wes and drunk Glenn&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Wes and drunk Glenn
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is one thing which slightly takes the edge off of my sadness, and that is that Wes truly took to heart the idea that life is, in fact, short. Whether you are forced to leave early, or whether you pass the century mark like my great aunt Cynthia, this is it. One life. One brief time on this pale blue dot floating through the universe. And just like us, Wes decided that he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend all of his brief time here spending fifty weeks a year at a job and two weeks a year on vacation. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend 95% of his life in one place. He yearned to travel to &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; see as much of it as I can while it’s still here.&amp;rdquo; And he did. And that&amp;rsquo;s comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because in the end, there are no guarantees. But in spite of that fact, which we all &amp;lsquo;know&amp;rsquo; in our minds, most of us act like there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; guarantees, like we have all the time in the world. And while it would surely be crazy to live in constant fear of the future, isn&amp;rsquo;t it just as crazy to live in blissful ignorance? So do me a favor, and honor Wes&amp;rsquo; life and passing with a little introspection. If there is something you should do, or that you want to do, just stop right now and figure out how to make it happen. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s travel, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s volunteer work, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just spending more time with loved ones. But figure out how to do it now, not later, because later may never come, and all stories end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_4041&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/WesAndGlenn.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-4041 size-medium&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/images/2014/11/WesAndGlenn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;WesAndGlenn&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Me and my friend, Wes Nations, a.k.a. Johnny Vagabond
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; story ends, will it be one that others want to share? Will it inspire others to do likewise? If so, then your story will live on in the hearts and minds of others, and that makes you immortal. Wes was an inspiration, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a teller of stories, and that makes &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; immortal. His deeds and his words can reverberate down through time. I&amp;rsquo;m gutted that I will never again see him face to face, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell his stories, and our stories, again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that I&amp;rsquo;ll be telling others about him when I&amp;rsquo;m old and my travel days are over. I can almost picture it now, sitting around a table at some hole-in-the-wall dive bar in some foreign country with a bunch of backpackers trying to one-up each other with travel tales. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait my turn, then I&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;Cool story, bro, but that ain&amp;rsquo;t shit. Let me tell you about the legend of Johnny Vagabond.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Vagabondians Have Landed</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/vagabondians-landed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/vagabondians-landed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After downsizing in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, packing up our necessities for storage at our friend Tere&amp;rsquo;s house in Chapala while we spent three months back home in Texas, we have come back to roost in a village beside the biggest lake in Mexico, Lake Chapala. We have a quaint little apartment with beautiful views of the calm lake and surrounding mountains. Dixie&amp;rsquo;s wishes for a rooftop and a garden were granted by the Househunting Fairy Godmother, so all is well. We even have pretty darn good birdwatching from our windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village of Ajijic (Ah-hee-HEE) is home to thousands of people from America, Canada, and any European country you can name, and probably some you can&amp;rsquo;t. We really want to beef up our Spanish, but so much English is spoken here, that it makes motivation to insist on Spanish more difficult. We try to deal with Mexican vegetable stands and stores instead of Walmart whenever we can and try to be understood in our still-sad Spanglish. The next class at the Lake Chapala Society starts in December or January, and we plan to be there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_4024&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;../images/2014/11/sunrise.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunrise&#34; /&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Sunrise from the bedroom window
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mountains are huge and rugged, the flowers are a riot of color everywhere, the lake is gorgeous, sunrise and sunsets spectacular. Ajijic is home to artists of all ilks, so the creativity is astounding: murals on outer walls, art shops, jewelry makers, sculpture, photography, gardens, gourmet food. Every turn on a walk around town brings a new surprise to delight the senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_4025&#34;  class=&#34;wp-caption alignleft&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-4025 size-medium&#34; src=&#34;../images/2014/11/carnival1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;carnival1&#34; /&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Carnival rides for the San Andres festival
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lake Chapala Society is a huge organization started back in the &amp;lsquo;50s as a way to help foreign residents and give back to the community. There is a group for about every activity you can imagine as well as many charitable activities, so we plan to be busy here. At least Dixie plans to be busy while poor Glenn works hard with his web development business, supporting our vagabond lifestyle. Lots to do after hours together too, like sunset walks along the lake on the malecon, tons of music venues, copious numbers of restaurants and coffee on the plaza. And the weather is pretty perfect most of the time, so staying cooped up at home should not be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hola, Mexico &amp;#8212; hola Ajijic!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Year Outside The USA</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/year-outside-usa/</link>

  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocatépetl&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-3728 size-full&#34; src=&#34;http://50.22.11.21/~dixonbui/vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/popo1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View of Popocatépetl, the active volcano in Puebla, Mexico, east of Mexico City, as seen from the window on the left side of our plane.&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Popocatépetl -- the active volcano in Puebla, Mexico, east of Mexico City
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we almost made it. Unfortunately we screwed up and didn&amp;rsquo;t think things through and ended up returning from Mexico to the U.S. after only 360 days abroad. We missed that landmark by five days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not this year! We left the Ft. Lauderdale airport in Florida on June 30, 2013 and haven&amp;rsquo;t stepped foot on U.S. soil ever since. Today actually marks day 367, and it will be another month before we return to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, this might actually be the last time we&amp;rsquo;re outside the U.S. for this long, at least for the next few years. In November we&amp;rsquo;ll return to Mexico and set up shop back over on the West side, on Lake Chapala, south of Guadalajara. That means that, when it comes time to &amp;lsquo;reset&amp;rsquo; our tourist visas, we can&amp;rsquo;t just jump in a van and cross the border by lunchtime. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to fly, which opens up some new interesting opportunities to see family and for Glenn to maybe take in some extra work-related conferences. Our time outside of the U.S. will shrink to six-month windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of our lives, we never imagined spending this much time away from our home country. I was 46 before I ever (briefly) left the United States. A few short years later and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; in a foreign country and have been outside the U.S. for fourteen of the last eighteen months! We&amp;rsquo;re doing pretty much what we dreamed we would do when all of these crazy plans began to form in our heads back in late 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saripiqui River and Canopy Tour</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/saripiqui-river-canopy-tour/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a last-gasp effort to see something of the beautiful country of Costa Rica, and with a deal on a tour from a friend, I ventured out alone while Glenn continued to recover from his minor back injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Nice orchid&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497546273/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Nice orchid&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/9497546273_a2b8787d9a_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Nice orchid&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;While being driven out of town alone in a large tour van, via my splotchy Spanish, I finally understood he was taking me to meet another van.  Eventually by the side of the road there was a driver named Carlos and a personable, knowledgeable English/Spanish guide, also named Carlos, and a nice Brazilian couple, and we ventured forth.  Conversation went pretty well between Portuguese, Spanish, and English, and the drive was beautiful as Carlos pointed out the different ecological zones, rain forest, cloud forest, and over the continental divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497413937/&#34; title=&#34;Canopy tour and lunch grounds&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Canopy tour and lunch grounds&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/9497413937_a3104f4e48_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Canopy tour and lunch grounds&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at a remote property, we went through a gate, down a path, and arrived under a big palapa where there was fresh fruit laid out for us, the sweetest papaya I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had, succulent pineapple, and some fresh bananas.  There were four very cute bats hanging out above, watching us devour our treats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497550527/&#34; title=&#34;Firefly Forest Proboscis Bats hanging from palapa ovrhead&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Firefly Forest Proboscis Bats hanging from palapa ovrhead&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3788/9497550527_12969dbc74_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Firefly Forest Proboscis Bats hanging from palapa ovrhead&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just down the path we met our tour boat, and &amp;ndash; after some tinkering with the engine &amp;ndash; off we went down the Sarapiqui River, our guide pointing out the wildlife while the driver brought us right in close for pictures.  Lizards and monkeys and crocodiles, oh my!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9500310444/&#34; title=&#34;Granddaddy croc&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Granddaddy croc&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5445/9500310444_a2451417dc_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Granddaddy croc&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pleasant hour later, we climbed the stairs into the jungle for ziplining and lunch.  I was the only taker for the canopy tour, so the Brazilians relaxed and photographed birds while I was geared and helmeted up, led to my horse, and away we went, two walking along the road and three riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497402681/&#34; title=&#34;Me and my horse to the ziplines&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Me and my horse to the ziplines&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7387/9497402681_783dbaca3e_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me and my horse to the ziplines&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 10-15 minutes we arrived at the beginning of the zip course.  I looked up the ladder and, holy crap!  About 50 feet up that ladder was the first platform. Boy, did my lack of Jazzercizing show!  &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;  I must have climbed halfway up the Empire State Building between all the high ladders at each platform.  At the end I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it to be the last, but I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t have survived many more ladders!  My two hunky-boy guides were a lot of fun and totally professional, much attention paid to safety on the well-maintained zip course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9497405195/&#34; title=&#34;Made it up the ladder&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Made it up the ladder&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3759/9497405195_a30a980fe3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Made it up the ladder&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was strongly suggested that canopy tour participants not take their cameras, because the guides would take pictures, so I have none, except a couple I sneaked of the slide show afterwards.  I found it really strange that nobody actually hit me up to buy the pictures.  Such a difference from other countries where there would have been a hard sell. The only animals I saw in the jungle were a pretty orange poison dart frog along the trail and a few battalions of ginormous mosquitoes.  Amazingly, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be too hungry; just a couple toothy vampires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9500267584/&#34; title=&#34;Blue jeans poison dart frog&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Blue jeans poison dart frog&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5496/9500267584_7ece833a8f_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blue jeans poison dart frog&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was typical Costa Rican fare: beans and rice/rice and beans, some pieces of grilled chicken, some salad-y stuff, and a very sweet fruit drink.  Our guide then led us down to a small building where they housed several local species of snakes, from a couple of large boas to some highly venomous vipers, the dreaded fer-de-lance and a pretty yellow eyelash viper. We were told that they only keep them for a little while and then release them as they catch new ones.  The collection was smaller than usual at this time. Next door was another greenhouse building where lots of blue jeans poison dart frogs lived. So cute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9500188100/&#34; title=&#34;DSCN1151&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;DSCN1151&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/9500188100_3f09621c32_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DSCN1151&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back on the road and experienced an absolute downpour for about half the drive back, up from the river into the cloud forest and back down into drenched San Jose. Enjoy the slide show!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Organic Tianguis -- we finally made it!</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/organic-tianguis-finally/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/organic-tianguis-finally/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What the heck is a &amp;ldquo;tianguis&amp;rdquo;? you might ask.  Well, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s loosely translated as a flea market. Back in Chapala, Jalisco, MX, they had the weekly tianguis, and you could buy almost anything there. Blocks of temporary stalls lining both sides of the street, everything from shoes to clothing to jewelry to toys; live farm animals and all kinds of fresh produce; stalls where savory food was prepared before your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Ground stall at the market&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8003360376_a51034ffe8_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ground stall at the market&#34; width=&#34;251&#34; height=&#34;188&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Live chickens&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8033/8003358317_4dca166e5c_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Live chickens&#34; width=&#34;253&#34; height=&#34;189&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Lots of fresh local fruit&#34; src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/8003355331_6ea952137f_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lots of fresh local fruit&#34; width=&#34;256&#34; height=&#34;192&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in San Cristobal, Chiapas, MX, they have a huge market selling all kinds of things daily. The stalls are set up each morning early with a dazzling array of items. It covers several blocks, including permanent buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Organic market 1&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/13966800330_9c98e6a407_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Organic market 1&#34; width=&#34;380&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Organic market 2&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7437/14153460275_bc4a63b8c5_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Organic market 2&#34; width=&#34;378&#34; height=&#34;283&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today we finally made it to the organic tianguis housed twice weekly in a building near one of the walking streets. It&amp;rsquo;s small, but the local farmers and sellers grow and use all organic methods. No chemical pesticides, hormones, antibiotics in their wares. The veggies and greens are just beautiful and full, not the wilty, buggy stuff you often find at the big market or the dried-out, old produce you often find at the big grocery stores. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, there are some beautiful offerings at the big market too, just not all are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this little market, people make fresh breads, salsas, sauces, pizzas, cheeses, desserts, local honey and other offerings. Beautiful fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/14153319285/&#34; title=&#34;Organic veg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Organic veg&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/14153319285_3e298b3d25_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Organic veg&#34; width=&#34;246&#34; height=&#34;185&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Organic fruits&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5536/14153447625_48a85bc93a_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Organic fruits&#34; width=&#34;248&#34; height=&#34;186&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Organic market 3&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5274/14130274046_7cfb7fc782_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Organic market 3&#34; width=&#34;249&#34; height=&#34;187&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a table with freshly butchered rabbit and chicken, homemade sausages and other meats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Fresh meat&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/13966659468_fece8eb6de_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fresh meat&#34; width=&#34;531&#34; height=&#34;398&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we were after k&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;ombucha, which is a lightly effervescent fermented drink (not alcoholic) that is loaded with probiotics. The lady had jamaica (hibiscus) and lemon-hierbabuena (lemon-mint) flavors. Mmmm, so nice and healthful! We also bought a nice loaf of homemade bread from her, and a hunk of soft, flavored homemade cheese from another lady that hails from Argentina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/13968097090/&#34; title=&#34;Kombucha&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; style=&#34;float: left;&#34; title=&#34;Kombucha&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2903/13968097090_59647d602d_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kombucha&#34; width=&#34;527&#34; height=&#34;395&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will definitely be back regularly to purchase produce and chicken and other tasty treats &amp;ndash; and definitely more kombucha!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guy totally gets it. He escaped &amp;ndash; will you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nyti.ms/1s0fcv2&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-foundation-featured-image wp-image-3639&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/slomo-900x507.png&#34; alt=&#34;slomo&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;422&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Kitchin quit a medical career to pursue his passion: skating along the boardwalk of San Diego’s Pacific Beach. He calls himself “Slomo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick, potentially life-changing video &amp;ndash; 16 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Four Foolish Years</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/four-foolish-years/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/four-foolish-years/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four years ago &amp;ndash; we moved out of our 2,000 square foot home with the three-car garage and downsized to an apartment. On purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three years ago &amp;ndash; we moved out of the apartment and were officially homeless, living in a popup camper for six months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two years ago &amp;ndash; we were living in Chapala, Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, nothing significant happened. We were back in the USA visiting family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this year, it&amp;rsquo;s back! April Fool&amp;rsquo;s day is, once again, a standout day on our calendar. Not because of where we are, or where we are going. Today is a big deal because we have been selected as the winners of the &lt;a title=&#34;oDesk Digital Nomad Contest Winners&#34; href=&#34;https://www.odesk.com/blog/2014/04/digital-nomad-winner-quit-sold-hit-road/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;oDesk.com Digital Nomad contest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re officially Digital Nomads now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, we were already that. But we were selected from almost 2,000 entries! We won! And we get some amazing cool prizes! Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s included in our Digital Nomad Survival Kit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An official oDesk Digital Nomad t-shirt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A super-cool North Face Surge II backpack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An iPad Mini with an official custom oDesk Digital Nomad case!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A92P_A7U_hero.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-3630&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A92P_A7U_hero.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A92P_A7U_hero&#34; width=&#34;257&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ipad-mini-step1-black-2013.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-3631&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ipad-mini-step1-black-2013.png&#34; alt=&#34;ipad-mini-step1-black-2013&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;195&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s some more good news &amp;#8212; you, too, can be a Digital Nomad! No, really. Check out this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in joining the Digital Nomad revolution? I can think of no better place to start than &lt;a title=&#34;oDesk&#34; href=&#34;http://odesk.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;oDesk&lt;/a&gt;. Interested in hiring a freelancer? &lt;a title=&#34;oDesk&#34; href=&#34;http://oDesk.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Same answe&lt;/a&gt;r!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three Years Ago We Quit Our Jobs And Ran Away From Home</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/three-years-ago-quit-jobs-ran-away-home/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today. Three years ago today was our &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/escaping-system/&#34; title=&#34;Escaping the System&#34;&gt;last day at work&lt;/a&gt;. We celebrated with friends and co-workers, we said our goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011-Texas-209.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-3369 alignnone&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011-Texas-209.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dixie Going Away Party&#34; width=&#34;614&#34; height=&#34;461&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a week we had finished cleaning out our apartment and were &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/homeless-living-car/&#34; title=&#34;We Are Homeless and Living in our Car&#34;&gt;officially homeless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0366.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2863 alignnone&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0366.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_0366-300x225&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/bigger-tent-wheels/&#34; title=&#34;A Bigger Tent – on Wheels&#34;&gt;lived in a pop-up camper&lt;/a&gt; for several months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Trailer.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2929 alignnone&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Trailer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Trailer-538x195&#34; width=&#34;538&#34; height=&#34;195&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/grand-canyon-north-rim/&#34; title=&#34;Grand Canyon – North Rim&#34;&gt;amazing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/grove-titans/&#34; title=&#34;Grove of Titans&#34;&gt;things &lt;/a&gt;all over &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/yellowstone/&#34; title=&#34;Yellowstone&#34;&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; America&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bryce.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-3072 alignnone&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bryce.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bryce-624x351&#34; width=&#34;624&#34; height=&#34;351&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/glenn-2-0-2011-review/&#34; title=&#34;Glenn 2.0 – 2011 in Review&#34;&gt;family &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/seattle/&#34; title=&#34;Seattle&#34;&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iowa.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-foundation-featured-image wp-image-3606&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iowa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;iowa&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;562&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/leavin-jet-plane/&#34; title=&#34;Well We’re Leavin’ on a Jet Plane…&#34;&gt;moved to Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/mexico.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1001&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/mexico.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mexico&#34; width=&#34;539&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/death-and-beyond-in-guanajuato-mexico/&#34; title=&#34;Death and Beyond in Guanajuato, Mexico&#34;&gt;amazing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/jungle-ancients-yaxchilan-bonampak/&#34; title=&#34;Jungle Ancients:  Yaxchilan, Bonampak&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; all over &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/happy-year-times-awastin/&#34; title=&#34;Happy New Year! Time’s A’wastin’!&#34;&gt;Mexico &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/grand-tour-of-the-islets-granada-nicaragua/&#34; title=&#34;Grand Tour of the Islets, Granada, Nicaragua&#34;&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/saripiqui-canopy-tour/&#34; title=&#34;Saripiqui River and Canopy Tour, Costa Rica&#34;&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MuseodeMumios.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1384&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MuseodeMumios.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;MuseodeMumios&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we broke out of the cycle. We did the unexpected, the unusual. We changed the course of our lives.  Instead of doing what everyone else does and following our expected path, we took the next exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Escaped Normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three years now we have been traveling, seeing new places and meeting new people. We have been collecting memories and experiences. And we&amp;rsquo;ve been sharing them with you, our friends and family and followers. Thanks for coming along for the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, on to the next three&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2013 -- A Brief Summary</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/2013-a-brief-summary/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So 2013 was a pretty interesting year. We started in Mexico, visited Belize, spent five months back in Texas, visited Nicaragua, visited Costa Rica, then ended up right back in Mexico! We&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks in sunny Merida. So far, that&amp;rsquo;s the most countries we&amp;rsquo;ve ever visited in one year. In 2014 we&amp;rsquo;ll visit at least Mexico and Guatemala, not sure beyond that. So &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s do this!&lt;/p&gt;
