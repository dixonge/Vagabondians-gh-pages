      <description>&lt;p&gt;So 2013 was a pretty interesting year. We started in Mexico, visited Belize, spent five months back in Texas, visited Nicaragua, visited Costa Rica, then ended up right back in Mexico! We&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks in sunny Merida. So far, that&amp;rsquo;s the most countries we&amp;rsquo;ve ever visited in one year. In 2014 we&amp;rsquo;ll visit at least Mexico and Guatemala, not sure beyond that. So &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s do this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Escape from Managua, Nicaragua</title>

  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9240886396&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;The malecon in Managua, Nicaragua&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5333/9240886396_92b01f58c2_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The malecon in Managua, Nicaragua&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;768&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone alignleft&#34; title=&#34;The malecon in Managua, Nicaragua&#34; src=&#34;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5333/9240886396_92b01f58c2_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The malecon in Managua, Nicaragua&#34; width=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;Yeah, we should have known that when the guidebooks say it&#39;s not worth hanging in Managua, they are probably right. We walked around. We took a taxi to see the park at the volcano that overlooks the city but were thwarted. There was some kind of official visitation going on there, and they turned us away. We had the taxi take us to the Xolotlan malecon, where there was a fee to get in of about $.50 each. We walked around looking at big Lake Managua and had a decent lunch with beers for cheap at one of the nice cafes there. We saw a Sponge Bob and friend that were in need of a bath and a Barney walking around getting cordobas for posing with park visitors. The lake cruise boat came and went a couple of times. A nice diversion at the lake, but hardly worth coming all the way to Managua for if you&#39;re a tourist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;width: 1034px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taxi to the bus station the next morning went to the other end of Managua, and the scenery didn&amp;rsquo;t change. A poor city with little to offer for tourism, though they seem to be working on that some. The bus ride out showed us somewhat of a downtown area with business people bustling around a little more modern buildings, but it was not what I would call big city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;width: 778px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9238132185&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Sign in our bathroom, Casa de los Abuelos, Managua, Nicaragua&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7409/9238132185_61d6790e23_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sign in our bathroom, Casa de los Abuelos, Managua, Nicaragua&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eager to escape, we rose early after our second night in the fairly expensive ($35 US) humble hotel in Managua. The owner and staff were very nice and helpful, however, and I would definitely recommend it if you must go to Managua: Hostal Casa de los Abuelos. English spoken there! Â  Both bus stations in Managua are most definitely &amp;ldquo;third-world.&amp;rdquo; But the transportation is cheap and, um, efficient. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get a (cramped) seat on the bus you want, you can still get on and ride on a stool in the aisle &amp;ndash; and you can bring your puppy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;width: 810px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  The owner of this puppy lives in Matagalpa and was extremely nice and helped us get a taxi to take us to a budget hostal. He sincerely wanted us to like his city. We even ran into him on the street later on and had a quick conversation before he went to his meeting. Matagalpa is a bustling little city, definitely more attractive than Managua, but it&#39;s no San Cristobal de las Casas &amp;#8212; we got so spoiled there! There are few tourists here with little to draw them, in the rainy season at least. I&#39;m not that eager to hike in the mud or tour coffee plantations. Call me wimpy. We are staying at the Hotel la Profe, which is an upgrade at less than half the price of Managua ($14US). We even have hot water and a fan on the ceiling! Also a nice little porch room to sit and compute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a title=&#34;The relaxing patio&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9342817313/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;The relaxing patio&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/9342817313_fb83a17943_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The relaxing patio&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Beautiful courtyard of la Profe&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9345602878/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Beautiful courtyard of la Profe&#34; src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/9345602878_ee6c5a4266_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Beautiful courtyard of la Profe&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed for two nights, enjoyed a local coffee shop for cafe con leche and wifi. Then we headed back down out of the mountains into Granada. Apparently, we like more touristy places where we can meet more travelers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Destination: Nicaragua</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/destination-nicaragua/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/destination-nicaragua/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At long, LONG last we&amp;rsquo;ve finally purchased tickets for our next destination: Nicaragua! We are so excited. We&amp;rsquo;ll even get to hook up with our buddy &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnnyvagabond.com&#34; title=&#34;Jonny Vagabond&#34;&gt;Wes Nations&lt;/a&gt; again! Fun times will be had. Sober times, not so much&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2469 aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://vagabondians.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nicaragua.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nicaragua&#34; width=&#34;529&#34; height=&#34;510&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have certainly enjoyed being able to see family and friends again, and even new family (sort of, long story) but living here is making us gain weight and spend too much money! We will miss my parents and brother and sister-in-law and my daughter and grandkids, and all of our friends, but we started getting antsy to get on the road again after about 90 days. But we did what we came to do, and now we&amp;rsquo;re getting back to the travel. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list of things we accomplished in addition to seeing people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 14px;&#34;&gt;Dixie finished her TEFL certification and is now prepped to teach English&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dixie&amp;rsquo;s sister in California got to fly in and visit us for a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glenn discovered that people will actually pay for him to set up, maintain and repair web sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dixie got to fly to Michigan to visit her sister and family there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glenn got to attend a WordPress business and development conference in Austin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We sold our MacBooks and iPods and bought new, cheap laptops and Android smartphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We both got Keen sandals!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we&amp;rsquo;re off for the next phase. After a year in Mexico w/ short side-trips to Guatemala and Belize, it&amp;rsquo;s time to dig in to Central America. We&amp;rsquo;re skipping Honduras and El Salvador for various visa-related reasons and heading to Managua, Nicaragua. But not for long. The general consensus is that Managua isn&amp;rsquo;t that fun, so we&amp;rsquo;re planning on taking the first bus to Matagalpa and we&amp;rsquo;ll travel around from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 17 days until departure!&lt;/p&gt;
