      <title>Grand Canyon -- North Rim</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Dixie and I got all packed up and headed north. After leaving Flagstaff we crossed a barren stretch of land. Most of the Native American reservations appear this way. The one good thing about rez land out here is that at least there is an ancient connection between the people and the land. There are many ancient ruins indicating thousands of years of Pueblo and Navajo ancestors. But it&amp;rsquo;s still desert, and we took anything resembling decent land away long ago. But I digress&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/252925_237999046216923_218850_n.jpg&#34;&gt;https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/252925_237999046216923_218850_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed the Little Colorado River and then eventually made it to the main branch, crossing it at the site of the Navajo Bridge. The original old bridge was built in 1927, and at the time it was the only place to cross the Colorado River for 400 miles in either direction. And it pretty much stayed that way for a long time. Seventy years passed before a new bridge was built to handle the increased traffic and vehicle sizes and to provide safety for the inevitable pedestrian traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074586309369&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074586309369&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074776309350&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237074776309350&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then traveled through more desolate land, and up windy roads until we got to the top of the Kaibab Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237999202883574&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237999202883574&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on in to camp, it was all trees. Pinyon Pines, Ponderosa Pines. Tall trees. It was nice to camp in the trees for once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had the TikiBaRV all set up in the Kaibab CampeRVillage (yes, I know, that is a lot of crazy letter play) we took off to see the canyon from the north side. It was a good 40 miles to get there, and most of it goes through a large open meadow in the middle of forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682276248600&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682276248600&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got there we wandered into the main lodge building. The original lodge burned down just a few years after construction, but the replacement has been here since 1937.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675376249290&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675376249290&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went into the bar, which is also the coffee shop. Unfortunately the afternoon bartender isn&amp;rsquo;t a barista, so no espresso for Glenn &lt;em&gt;sob&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; so we had coffee instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675659582595&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675659582595&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lodge lobby connects to a large viewing room with floor to ceiling windows, large comfy chairs and couches and a massive view of the canyon. The construction is all heavy timber and stone. It is the quintessential lodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675999582561&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237675999582561&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went back down for some hiking. We started off with the easy stuff, the Bright Angel Point trail, and the Transept Trail. Bright Angel Point goes out a narrow ridge to a great overlook point. It is easily accessible from the Lodge, thus everyone goes there. Very crowded. On the way back, if you take the branch to the left you go below the lodge. Once we passed the lodge, the traffic disappeared. We hiked around the edge and eventually came back to the main road after cutting through the employee lodging area. Two or three hours of hiking through trees. It was very nice. Dixie hugged a lot of Ponderosa Pines too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237680656248762&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237680656248762&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the lodge we saw some chipmunks and a Stellar&amp;rsquo;s Jay! We also saw an older guy taking pictures of the canyon with a white iPad 2. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681576248670&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681576248670&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning as I was working on the computer and Dixie was cooking breakfast I saw something out of the corner of my eye through our vinyl window. At first I thought it was someone&amp;rsquo;s pet, but I focused for a second and there it was &amp;ndash; a Kaibab Squirrel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681952915299&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237681952915299&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on a mission, so I barely got any photos before it was too far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682162915278&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682162915278&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the cousin of the Abert&amp;rsquo;s Squirrel on the South Rim, which we never got to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we drove back down to the rim, taking an eastern road that led up to Cape Royal. A LOT of people go here, because it is a very short hike to the rim and it is a spectacular view. Nearby is the Angel Window, also quite spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682412915253&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237682412915253&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back in we did the hike out to Cape Final, about three hours round trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237684689581692&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237684689581692&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685129581648&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685129581648&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the campsite we were treated to an awesome sunset viewed through the dead trees of the Outlet Fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685686248259&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237685686248259&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237675012915993.83451.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of signs at all of the National Parks talking about fire. Evidently the Park Service has finally figured out that fires are natural and should not necessarily be put out every time one starts up. Because if you do, then all of the fuel (dead trees and limbs) just builds up and then you have a massive fire that is bad. And by bad, I mean that it kills ALL the trees. Normal fires don&amp;rsquo;t. Yep, yet another example of man screwing up nature. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Williams, Arizona</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/williams-arizona/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What? You&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of the famous Williams, Arizona?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, me neither. But, that is where we ended up for almost a week. This time it wasn&amp;rsquo;t due to system issues with the trailer, more like system issues with Glenn. Some sort of head cold: congestion, sore throat, coughing. Not an ideal condition for hiking on dry, dusty trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there were actually a few things to do and see in the area. Williams, Arizona bills itself as the Gateway to the Grand Canyon. Of course there are plenty of other routes you can use that don&amp;rsquo;t go through Williams, but they do have a few things going for them. There is a nice road that goes straight north out of Williams to the southern entrance of the park. It is about sixty miles away. They also have a nice train that runs from Williams to the Canyon and back every day. And Williams also happens to be on historical Route 66. Add all those together and you have yourself a tourist haven! We mainly went into town for groceries, laundry, and the occasional movie rental, but it looked like a fun place to visit if you ride a motorcycle or are out exploring with the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237124342971060&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237124342971060&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Highway 64 going north you will pass the Red Lake Texaco about 8 miles north of I-40. That is where we holed up. Nice, cheap RV sites out back. LOTS of tour buses stop here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237123806304447&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237123806304447&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the road to the park is populated only by the occasional tourist trap, which typically consist of a gas station, Navajos selling jewelry and pottery, and one or two other services thrown in. We got a kick out of Bedrock City in Valle, AZ. It is an RV park, restaurant, gift shop, and some kind of amusement park all themed on, yes, the Flintstones. It looks like it was built in the 60&amp;rsquo;s and then left to rot. But they will still charge you $5 to go in and see the dinosaur slide, the graffiti-filled buildings, the decaying rides and attractions that used to work&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237125872970907&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237125872970907&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I had already read about this place online, so we just pulled up out front, got a few pictures, and saved ourselves $10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237126059637555&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=237126059637555&amp;amp;#038;set=a.237123732971121.83228.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday we packed up, drove into Flagstaff, picked up our new WiFi Hotspot device and drove north through the desolate (yet pretty) landscape that is Arizona to the Kaibab CampeRVillage up on the plateau. Today&amp;rsquo;s agenda includes a 40-mile drive down to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon to see what we can see. More pics soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Now We&#39;re Cooking With Gas</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/cooking-gas/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/cooking-gas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just thought I would give an update on our gas situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my previous posts, you may remember our problems with the gas system working and not working and back and forth. The night we pulled back in to the RV park right next to Camping World in Albuquerque I was able to get all gas appliances, including the furnace, to work. Here is the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the night the furnace stopped working again. In the morning we took the trailer back to Camping World. We had an appointment. While we drove around and ran some errands, the technicians there attempted to make the furnace fail again. When they finally called us it had worked for 12 attempts in a row. After we arrived we tried it again ourselves. It lit every time, the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing they had actually done to it was that one of their techs had &amp;ldquo;blown it out,&amp;rdquo; whatever that means. So we took the trailer back next door to the Enchanted Trails RV Park and set it all up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, the furnace stopped working again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, as we lay in our sleeping bags, too cold to get out, with our 1500 Watt electric heater straining to keep the temperature up to 55 degrees, Dixie had an idea. Maybe, just maybe, it was the $13 Wal-Mart tank gauge that was causing the problem? I thought it was probably the regulator, but the gauge was something that I could test much more easily. So I got up and tested a few things. The stovetop burners could be lit, but the flame fluctuated. The furnace was definitely not getting enough gas to light. So I got dressed, grabbed a crescent wrench and went outside and removed the gauge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, as they say, is all she wrote. It&amp;rsquo;s been a week now, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t had a single problem with our gas or our furnace!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After leaving Winslow we drove through Flagstaff and on to Williams, Arizona. About nine miles north of I-40 is an interesting little place near Red Lake which is a combination gas station/convenience store/hostel/RV park. The RV spots are out back and are very basic, just water and electricity. But restrooms are close and very nice, and coin-operated showers are available as well. It is a nice and inexpensive place to begin our exploration of the South Rim from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had the trailer set up we took off for the park to get a first glimpse before dark. Our National Parks Passport got us in for free, saving us $25. Soon we&amp;rsquo;ll break even on the Passport purchase! We drove past the main visitor center over to Yavapai Point. Unlike Clark Griswold, we did not merely glance and leave! We took many photos in the last thirty minutes before sundown, then joined everyone else enjoying the setting sun. We even got to see a California Condor soaring on the updrafts. Soon the sun began to set, and as the last of the orange ball disappeared over the horizon a collective sigh was uttered and then everyone got up to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235624139787747&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235624139787747&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234610276555800.82233.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back out of the park I took a wrong turn which took us past a sign that mentioned something about an evening program. We investigated further and it turned out to be a presentation on the California Condors and their rescue from near-extinction. It was very informative and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove back up and stopped at all of the main lookouts and attractions from the visitors center eastward to the Desert View Watchtower. After that we drove around and explored the Geology Museum, the market village, and the lodge area. On the way back south we stopped in Tusayan and investigated the Grand Canyon Camper Village. It seemed about as basic as where we were staying, and was a little more expensive, but it was 45 miles closer to the park! We made reservations for the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winslow, Arizona -- June 8</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Woke up in Holbrook and packed up and folded down. We&amp;rsquo;re getting pretty good at this! It takes us 15-30 minutes to pack up clothes and misc. items and transfer them to the Montero, then a good 30 minutes to zip, fold, flip, slide, disconnect, stow and crank down the top on the popup. Learned a little lesson about water pressure today, too. See, up until now we turn off the water faucet, disconnect the hose, and all the excess water pressure in the system bleeds out of the hose end. BUT &amp;#8212; we had to get smart and add a quick-connect thingamabob to the side of the trailer. And one thing about quick-connects is that, well, when you DISconnect one side of this connection, the other side seals off. So when we did this today, the trailer water was still under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235295969820564&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235295969820564&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any way, we decided to bleed all the water out of the hot water heater because at 8.3 pounds per gallon, that&amp;rsquo;s about 50 extra pounds to tow around. So I unscrew the drain plug and &amp;#8212; wait for it&amp;hellip;.. &amp;#8212; whoosh! Pressurized hot water all over my pants leg. Felt kinda stupid. At least it wasn&amp;rsquo;t TOO hot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way, we finally got on the road and our next stop was Winslow, Arizona. I found an intersection with a street sign, and as a bonus the light pole behind it had a flag/banner with the town name on it. That was the picture I had envisioned. Of course the town is aware of its infamy in song too. Jackson Browne visited in 1971 and wrote a song about it. Glenn Frey finished off one of the verses and the Eagles recorded it and put it on their first album. It became a trademark of their sound, and put Winslow, Arizona on the map for a whole generation. I have to imagine that countless thousands of people stopped here just because of that song. Of course, it didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that historic Route 66 passed through town, but the vast majority of travelers just zipped on by on I-40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606203222874&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606203222874&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 90&amp;rsquo;s a number of initiatives to revitalize Winslow took shape. One of them involved the famous song. In 1999 the town dedicated the &amp;ldquo;Standing On The Corner Park&amp;rdquo; so now you can pose next to a statue of what appears to be Jackson Browne in front of a mural which contains an Eagle, a couple in a window, and a girl in a flat bed ford, all the while being seranaded by Eagles tunes coming from the gift shop next door. So we posed and took pictures like all the other turistas, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got my own separate photo that I consider unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235311309819030&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=235311309819030&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though that song and that park draw tourists in, the main tourist attraction in town is La Posada. We first heard about this place from the owner of Tinkertown in Albuquerque. She raved about it, and rightly so! This building is amazing. It was the last link in an entire chain of railroad hotels set up by Fred Harvey. His chain brought linen tablecloths and silverware to an otherwise rough old west railroad travel at several major stops on the Santa Fe line. It was immortalized in a movie starring Judy Garland called &amp;ldquo;The Harvey Girls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606099889551&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234606099889551&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234606056556222.82230.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Posada was designed by renowned Southwest architect Mary Colter. It was open from 1930 to 1957. Santa Fe Railways auctioned off the museum-quality furnishings in 1959 and gutted half of the building for office space in the early 1960&amp;rsquo;s. Several times it was scheduled for demolition, and in 1994 the railway moved out for good, again promising demolition. The current owners obtained it after many years of legal negotiations and began renovations in 1997. Allen Affeldt and his wife Tina Mion have done a miraculous job so far. And the future plans are no less incredible! I could write about this for a long time, but I will spare you and instead refer you to links (below) where you can find out everything there is to know about this wonderful place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wallow Fire -- Eastern Arizona</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/wallow-fire-eastern-arizona/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 29 an unattended campfire started what has now become the 3rd or 2nd largest fire in Arizona history at over 300,000 acres. [&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: the fire topped out over 500,000 acres, the largest in state history] On June 2, the day the winds first whipped this fire into a massive beast, smoke poured across the state line into western New Mexico and settled into the Rio Grande valley, covering the greater Albuquerque area in smoke and ash. The city&amp;rsquo;s emergency management facilities were overwhelmed with calls to 911 and 511 reporting a fire. The city finally got through to all of the local news channels to tell people to stop calling so that real emergencies could be reported. Fire crews drove all over looking for actual fires but found none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234987309851430&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234987309851430&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took awhile but word finally got out that the smoke was from Arizona. Smoke from that fire has been seen as far away as Iowa! After we finally managed to get out of town and headed for Arizona ourselves on Monday, June 6, we still had to drive through the smoke near Gallup on I-40. By this time the smoke wasn&amp;rsquo;t as bad or as thick, and soon we were in clear skies. But the massive smoke plume was easily visible both that day in Holbrook and the next day when we visited the Petrified Forest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234687149881446&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=234687149881446&amp;amp;#038;set=a.234686909881470.82276.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pictures I took from different vantage points:&lt;/p&gt;
