      <description>&lt;p&gt;We first met our wine-making friends Del and Kat Erickson in 2007 when Kat and her daughter Jessica came to Texas for Winestock. Since we were fairly nearby we veered a bit north and dropped in for a visit. We got to see their house, her husband Del&amp;rsquo;s farm, daughter Jessica&amp;rsquo;s family in Grand Forks, ND and much more. Enjoy the slideshow, read the captions!&lt;/p&gt;
