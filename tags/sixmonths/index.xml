      <description>&lt;p&gt;On September 2, we finally left Wyoming and headed for northern Minnesota. The first night we made it as far as eastern Montana. On the way, we passed what is possibly the funniest high school mascot we&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Belfry bats&#34; src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BX5sD-eeo7E/TpGEjARN9_I/AAAAAAAAB_g/irZYeajEIRI/s640/SAM_0738.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;a bat!&#34; src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VUy2vNPYsXg/TpGElPZV6bI/AAAAAAAAB_k/I-v2fSRhqv4/s640/SAM_0739.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, if your town is named Belfry, what else are you going to have for a mascot? LOL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Eastern Montana for the first night, then headed East in the morning. It was the first ever visit for both of us to North Dakota, another first in a long line of firsts for us on this trip! Also, we&amp;rsquo;re evidently close to Canada..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Oh Canada!&#34; src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-10XmcR4Vz6E/TpGEoStU-zI/AAAAAAAAB_o/RbaXEQKTU6A/s640/P1160426.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;West of what?&#34; src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--24lmzpaPoc/TpGEqOcOk-I/AAAAAAAAB_s/vVmz1Y3zmhI/s640/SAM_0742.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve stopped at a lot of National Parks and Monuments on this trip. Almost all of them were planned ahead of time, but this one was a surprise &amp;ndash; Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much of a park, but is evidently popular for horseback riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;park sign&#34; src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wEGE8Ia3meM/TpGExai1rKI/AAAAAAAAB_4/nwDdSj0yEl8/s640/SAM_0752.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;horsies!&#34; src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-upzOKbUF7A4/TpGE69G8kAI/AAAAAAAACAI/_GqbGEsovn8/s640/SAM_0757.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Dakota looks a whole lot like South Dakota, without the Black Hills and massive sculptures of Presidents and native warriors. Not to be outdone, this state has the &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Largest Metal Sculptures&amp;rdquo; which you can see by driving the almost 64-mile round trip of the &lt;a title=&#34;Enchanted Highway&#34; href=&#34;http://www.enchantedhighway.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Enchanted Highway&lt;/a&gt;. We opted out, but took a few pictures along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Enchanted?&#34; src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--r1x--78z2I/TpGE8aeqWnI/AAAAAAAACAM/RnXcomC-skQ/s640/SAM_0761.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Geese&#34; src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ljYdvn9z7DI/TpGE-t0OhUI/AAAAAAAACAQ/J--KbFhCvUY/s640/SAM_0764.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Deer&#34; src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ib--kfKxBgg/TpGFDVER8fI/AAAAAAAACAY/229qmLtN4Js/s640/SAM_0766.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we passed the &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Largets Holstein Cow&amp;rdquo; near New Salem, ND. Great for a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;moo&#34; src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QrTEb24xH60/TpGFIHJgwiI/AAAAAAAACAg/gLnfqWSYOSk/s640/SAM_0776.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;MOO!&#34; src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EcC1hIpaVpA/TpGFKVSiCZI/AAAAAAAACAk/SDzeqe_bzj0/s640/SAM_0779.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for the night near Bismarck at a decent little park. When I went to switch the refrigerator from propane back over to electricity, I discovered a ton of red dirt had blown in while driving down I-90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Recession RV?&#34; src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-L0r2pMZ90GM/TpGFUSCSV9I/AAAAAAAACA4/pk2qZqbAs2w/s640/SAM_0786.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;dirt&#34; src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ak8pV7xZKYQ/TpGFYJw6mVI/AAAAAAAACBA/p1ePeYOAVRw/s640/IMG_0555.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we finally made our way to the home of Kat and Del Erickson in Warren, Minnesota. Check that out on Google Maps, but take my word for it &amp;ndash; the next thing to the north is Canada. We&amp;rsquo;re way up here in the middle of NOwhere!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see all the photos from this part of the trip here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Under the Big Sky</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/big-sky/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/big-sky/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So eventually we reached our destination in St. Regis and stayed there a couple of nights, catching up on laundry, rest, reading and writing. We then made our way to Deer Lodge, again staying two nights. Finally we drove south to West Yellowstone which we intended to use as a base for our Yellowstone explorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Welcome to Montana&#34; src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0Y4eE1w7IE8/Tmose5yEmSI/AAAAAAAABts/5I-araGR2o0/s640/P1150216.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered where the motto &amp;ldquo;Big Sky&amp;rdquo; came from. Obviously there are wide-open vistas here, but the same could be said for many places west of the Mississippi River. As it turns out, it started with a novel. A.B. Guthrie wrote a six-novel series of historical fiction on the settling of Montana, from 1830 to the beginning of World War I. The first novel of the series was sent to the publisher untitled. The editor read through it and the accompanying biographical notes and came across an exclamation from Guthrie&amp;rsquo;s father when he first arrived at Choteau, Montana: &amp;ldquo;standing under the big sky I feel free.&amp;rdquo; The editor chose &amp;ldquo;Big Sky&amp;rdquo; as the title. And in 1961 Guthrie gave the state permission to use it for tourism, and the phrase has stuck ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Wheat&#34; src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gdzNIRwwX8k/TniFAVYzPkI/AAAAAAAABzs/kCHPtgZUvbY/s640/P1150271.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Man&#39;s attempt to keep snow drifts off of the freeways&#34; src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BPgC5ompLOc/TniFXTEOWyI/AAAAAAAABzw/3kn8zy67eVE/s640/P1150273.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The western half of Montana has a lot of mountains and passes. Once we cleared most of those we headed south for West Yellowstone. The drive was very scenic. Mountains with snow, valleys, plains, meadows. Not very many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone&#34; title=&#34;Mountains&#34; src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IZ-0cuVZzR8/TniGf7vmrlI/AAAAAAAABz8/AlhsELxbiwk/s640/P1150282.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grove of Titans</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/grove-titans/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of our favorite authors are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prestonchild.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child&lt;/a&gt;. You may have seen the movie &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zuguide.com/#The-Relic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Relic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; which was based on some of their books. Douglas Preston has also written several non-fiction books which we love. Back in May of 2007 I stumbled across a book written by Douglas&amp;rsquo; brother, Richard, entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812975596/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=selfservehost-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0812975596&#34;&gt;The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; ahvsxllnypvwxbzmklmr&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0812975596&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;. We were captivated and enthralled by these stories of people exploring vast acres of previously unexplored redwood forests and finding and climbing taller and taller trees. We began reading everything we could find about these trees, in print or on the internet. Scientists have found entire ecosystems living in the upper branches over 300 feet from the forest floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this was something we were fascinated by, we had no hope of actually seeing them until we began planning our RV road trip. As I began to look for more details it became apparent that the tallest trees for which a location was public were not actually the tallest trees any more. These scientists and enthusiasts were discovering new ones all the time! As a matter of fact, most of the 25 tallest trees were in undisclosed locations. My enthusiasm began to wane. Sure, we could still see massive Sequoias and tall Coast Redwoods, but the tallest trees would be off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late July while we were in California I began researching again and looking through my notes so we could pick a park to stay in that was convenient to the biggest trees. Most of the tallest trees were in undisclosed locations in Redwood National Park and Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It became evident that I would be unable to see them. The tallest ones we could access had once been the tallest of all, back in the late 1950&amp;rsquo;s.  Now they weren&amp;rsquo;t even in the top 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was, however, one other way of measuring trees, and that is their volume. A couple of groves have been found where the trees may not be the tallest, but they are massive. One such area is the Atlas Grove in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. The tree named Illuvatar is there, the 3rd largest Coast Redwood (in volume). It has more reiteration (new trunks growing from the main trunk) than any other known tree. It basically looks like its own little forest. Three other trees in this park are in the top 10 of the largest Coast Redwoods. But like most big trees, the locations are being kept secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grove with the largest Coast Redwoods is the Grove of Titans in the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. The only &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; grove of these redwoods in the park is the Stout Grove, with the Stout Tree being touted as the largest. In fact, it is now only 28th largest! Four of the top 10 largest Cost Redwoods are in the Grove of Titans. And while its location is still officially undisclosed, others have found it and are dropping hints all over the internet. Some wish it to be fully open to the public, others want the park to put boardwalks around it and make it an official trail, like the Stout Grove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Stout Grove&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145310200/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Stout Grove&#34; src=&#34;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9145310200_60224cc046_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stout Grove&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent the possible disclosure, some are putting misleading information out there, including pins on Google Maps. While I was trying to decipher all of the clues I made a discovery. I found an actual map of the location of the Grove of Titans! We were scheduled to be there within 48 hours! I was so excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 3rd we drove into the park. Actually, we came in on the opposite side from where I had intended, but as it turns out this was the closest way in to the grove. We parked and headed out the appropriate trail, with me occasionally checking the map images I had downloaded to my iPhone. After a few false starts, we came to a spot and saw what &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been some large trees. It was difficult to tell, but the location matched the map. We waded through the underbrush no more than 300 feet or so, and there it was, a huge Coast Redwood. It was a mass of trees fused together near the base. It was the Fused Titan! We had found it, the Grove of Titans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9143087303/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/9143087303_45a6a6b5c0_n.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/9145313678/&#34; rel=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/9145313678_9f7e01eab5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fused Titan&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We marveled at its size. We took pictures. And then we consulted the map again, turned and headed toward the others. The next tree was the largest Coast Redwood known to man, the Lost Monarch. Somehow it was even larger than the previous one. Taking pictures is one thing, seeing it in person is quite another. And then the next tree, around a fallen giant, was El Viejo del Norte, with its signature &amp;lsquo;claw&amp;rsquo; extending towards the earth. Soon we climbed over another downed tree, or perhaps branch and found our way towards a large twin tree, fused near the base. But wait, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one we were looking for. That was the NEXT tree, the Screaming Titans! This pair of trees have fused from the ground up to a height of 20-25 feet. Their combined mass is possibly larger than many others, but because they are not technically one tree they don&amp;rsquo;t get categorized with all the rest. But at breast height they have a wider circumference than the massive Sequoia General Sherman!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  We spent at least an hour wandering the grove, taking it all in. Surprisingly we were not the only people there that day! Fortunately, the other explorer is someone who had previously discovered the grove and was giving his brother a tour. He gave us some clarifications on how to get to the other large tree, Del Norte which was across the river. Although we eventually found it we weren&#39;t prepared for water crossings and decided that we had seen enough for one day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although our trip is not yet over, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that anything will be able to surpass the feeling of standing in the middle of some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest living creatures. I think it will be the highlight of our journey through America. Then again, in two days we will be in Yellowstone!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bryce Canyon</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/bryce-canyon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we finally left the North Rim area of the Grand Canyon, we drove off of the Kaibab Plateau and over to Utah. We stopped for the night in Hatch in a nice little campground. Good prices and the most amazing bathrooms of the trip so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=255178074499020&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=255178074499020&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sunset we drove on into Bryce Canyon. On the way there we passed through Red Canyon, which has several smaller features and is a nice introduction to the area. We stopped for a few pictures, then drove on in. Once there, we drove up to a lookout point or two and hiked out to the viewing areas. The main roads are all on the western side of the canyon area, and you really can&amp;rsquo;t see much of anything until you hike out to an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248887708461390&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=248887708461390&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really was a stunning view. Some areas were perfectly lit by the setting sun, others looked like they would be optimally lit at sunrise. But the hoodoos were rather mesmerizing. We began to look forward to actually getting down among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252091171474377&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252091171474377&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we drove out early and got a good head start on the day. Inspiration point was glorious in the early morning sun. Then we prepared for our big hike. And let me at this point say a little something about warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=249780888372072&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signs at many National Parks attempt to warn people about the dangers of hiking. A sign at the Grand Canyon even has a photo of a woman who ran marathons who died out there on the trails. I take all such advice into consideration and try very hard not to be one of those statistics. And yet when we hit the trails we are surrounded by people who seem to have completely ignored all signs. They have very little water, if any. They are in tennis shoes. They are often very overweight. And yet all of these people (as far as I know) seem to manage to make it back to the parking lot just fine. WTF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the signs are overstating the dangers? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Just a few days ago two hikers surprised a mother Grizzly and her two cubs at Yellowstone. The Grizzly mauled and killed the male hiker on the spot. So one certainly needs to be careful out there. But we often feel a bit overdressed with our hiking shoes and Camelbak water backpacks and our daypack. But hey, at least we&amp;rsquo;ll have food to throw at any bears we encounter. &lt;img src=&#34;http://v2j.vagabondians.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:)&#34; class=&#34;wp-smiley&#34; style=&#34;height: 1em; max-height: 1em;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way, we left sunrise point and descended. It was a bit like stepping off of a spacecraft onto another planet. At every turn you got a whole new angle on everything in sight. The result of this was a bazillion photos. We eventually made our way to the bottom of the trail and took a snack break in the shade. Soon after we came to the final part of the trail, exiting the canyon. It was a series of steep switchbacks. Evidently they recommend this particular direction because this end of the trail has shade. Probably a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252092894807538&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252092894807538&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252116551471839&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252116551471839&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After surviving that trail, we drove down to the end of the park and hiked the Bristlecone Pine trail. Lots of crazy old trees out there. On the way back in, we stopped at several lookouts, eventually making our way back to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252141731469321&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252141731469321&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252142801469214&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&#34;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252142801469214&amp;amp;#038;set=a.248887665128061.84396.197146780302150&amp;amp;#038;type=1&amp;amp;#038;theater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryce Canyon was great, possibly Glenn&amp;rsquo;s favorite location so far!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amarillo -- May 1 and 2</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/amarillo-1-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/amarillo-1-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After escaping the rain in Lawton and the scary lady with a hammer, we stopped for a couple of days of work in Amarillo at the La Quinta East. I wrote stuff, Dixie wrote stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were there someone posted a picture of a ridiculous looking plane that was supposedly at the Amarillo Airport. Steve Miller said it should still be there, so we took a break to go see it. And there it was! Twice as tall as Southwest Airlines&amp;rsquo; 737&amp;rsquo;s. Very odd looking. No wonder they call it the Flying Guppy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/PBkMAQD.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Guppy vs. 737&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems that NASA acquired this thing to haul things around, like pieces of space shuttle or, in this case, a Bell Osprey. The nose of the plane swings to the right like a door, then you slide stuff inside. Strange, but true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was there I noticed another car pull up behind ours and the driver appeared to be writing down our temporary tag numbers. I wandered back over there and the driver asked what I was doing. I looked back at the plane, looked at him, looked back at the plane and pointed at it and said &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a flying guppy!&amp;rdquo; He acted like this was no big deal. I asked him who he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Floyd.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have just laughed. Instead I said &amp;ldquo;Oh&amp;rdquo; and just walked back to take more pictures. I kinda thought he might have been with the FAA or the airport, but no, he&amp;rsquo;s just an idiot who thought he had caught the next al Qaeda plot in action. Targeting the flying guppy. In Amarillo. What a maroon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I got photos of the plane, we discovered what appeared to be an old abandoned terminal building. The sign said &amp;ldquo;English Field.&amp;rdquo; After taking several photos we drove to the east side of the airport and discovered what appeared to be an old military complex. Large water towers with the typical checkered paint job, now fading. Lots of streets and curbs but very few buildings left. I took a lot more pictures, and we enjoyed some of the wildlife that now occupies this area, mainly jackrabbits and birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/ZhQW4mp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rabbits everywhere!&#34; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/xBHdP4M.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Swallow swarm&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got back to the hotel I Googled it and discovered that English Field was the commercial airport back in the day, and that the runways now being used by Amarillo International used to be part of an Army Air Field started up back in World War II. Since then thousands of jet crew and mechanics were trained there, the B-17 Flying Fortress flew out of there, and it also used to be a SAC base and boot camp. All the military stuff is long gone, but the runways make it ideal for things like space shuttles and flying guppies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/AwFBNaZ.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Abandoned terminal&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we met an old friend and storm-chasing buddy Steve Miller for lunch. We ended up spending 3-4 hours getting caught up on self-employment, love lives and storm chasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the full photo album:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catching Up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that I really like about other travel blogs that I read is when they write about where they are right now, not about some place they visited years ago.  We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to do that, but the tricky part is that we have been seeing so many places and taking so many pictures that it is difficult to keep up!  As a matter of fact, I (Glenn) am flat out behind.  But I&amp;rsquo;m about to catch up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for many, many posts about what we have been doing, the details.  And pictures too!  Coming really soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Bigger Tent -- on Wheels</title>
      <link>http://vagabondians.com/post/bigger-tent-wheels/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vagabondians.com/post/bigger-tent-wheels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a saying in the RV world, especially true for those who intend to travel full-time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy your third RV first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course most people start with a small travel trailer and graduate to a larger fifth-wheel.  Others start with a little Class C motor home (built on a van chassis) and end up driving one of those monster buses.  I think it is safe to say that Dixie and I are one of the very few to even attempt to travel full-time in nothing but a car and a tent.  As you know, the car required a quick upgrade to an SUV due to sheer overload.  But the tent worked fine, except that it quickly became obvious that steering clear of bad weather put us in a motel room far too often.  So we started looking at an upgrade and eventually found a used Jayco 14SO popup tent camper in decent condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen this unit referred to as &amp;lsquo;the palace&amp;rsquo; and for good reason.  It might sound silly at first, but in the popup tent camper world, this Jayco unit is the king-sized luxury model.  The main box is 14 feet long, 19 if you include the hitch.  But when the beds are folded out the length is a crazy 26 feet.  The width also increases due to a large slide-out!  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure about this one at first.  It seemed a bit large to haul with my mid-sized SUV.  But when I drove 20 miles on the Interstate from Camping World to the KOA Kampground I decided that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad.  We need to do something to the awning to keep it from bouncing too high in crosswinds, and you can&amp;rsquo;t drive 70mph with this thing, but the Montero Sport didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind too badly.  It remains to be seen how it handles on steeper inclines, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to see over the top with the rear-view mirror!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dealer gave it new tires/wheels and helped fix a few minor issues, but as we&amp;rsquo;ve been using it we&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a few more.  Nothing major, just handy-man stuff.  The setup isn&amp;rsquo;t bad, and one of the locals thought for sure we were seasoned travelers!  We have a fresh water tank, water pump, connection for city water, a water heater, and a small gas furnace.  We also have a toilet/shower combo.  The sink drains directly to the outside, the shower water drains to a grey water tank.  But the one thing that sets this unit apart from most others is the toilet.  The black water doesn&amp;rsquo;t go into a tank and you can&amp;rsquo;t connect this to a sewer connection in a full hook-up site.  This unit is equipped with a cassette toilet.  It holds around 5 gallons of black water.  When it is full, you simply open the outside hatch, slide the unit out and walk it over to the dump station and empty it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings up one strange problem.  As great as this unit is, you can&amp;rsquo;t get to the toilet cartridge access door to empty the black water while you have the main screen door in place.  It seems as if it was designed assuming that you would never need to empty the black water until you were leaving the campground.  Only when the main door is removed can the small external half-door close, and only when that door closes can you get full access to the toilet cartridge.  Seems like the kind of thing they should use in camper design class under &amp;ldquo;things not to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we picked it up from the dealer we drove it straight back to the KOA where we had been staying and drove into a nice pull-through site.  It was our 7th day in a row, so it was a free night!  We have spent the last two days reorganizing and rearranging and fixing and setting up and cleaning.  It is finally ready for travel, and we&amp;rsquo;ve got six months worth of travel left for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, back when we were planning on five year&amp;rsquo;s worth of RV travel, we had settled on a nickname for our trailer.  And even though we ended up with a popup, I think the nickname still fits.  See &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.www.vagabondians.dev/tiki-barv-reality&#34; title=&#34;Tiki BaRV Reality&#34;&gt;Dixie&amp;rsquo;s latest dispatch&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the TikiBaRV.&lt;/p&gt;
